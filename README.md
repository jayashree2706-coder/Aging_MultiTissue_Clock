## Project Overview
This project develops a multi-tissue transcriptomic aging clock using GTEx RNA-seq data.

The objectives include:
- Identification of age-associated genes
- Multi-tissue modeling
- LASSO-based age prediction
- Evaluation using R², MAE, RMSE
- Future integration of pharmacogenomic genes

## Methods
- Gene filtering
- Correlation-based pre-selection
- LASSO regression (glmnet)
- Cross-validation

## Current Status
Initial blood-tissue aging clock implemented.  
Multi-tissue expansion in progress.

## Future Directions
- External validation
- Pharmacogene integration
- Pathway enrichment analysis
- Multi-omics extension
